# IN180 - Leveraging Commands from “Piper” for CI/CD Setup with SAP Integration Suite

## Description

In this session, you will learn how to use SAP Integration Suite Piper commands for building Continues integration and Continuous development pipeline. SAP Integration Suite has contributed many steps to the library for project ["**Piper**"](https://www.project-piper.io)  that help you create your own continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, automating various tasks. Learn how to set up CI/CD pipelines for SAP Integration Suite on Jenkins and [**Continuous Integration and Delivery service**](https://help.sap.com/docs/CICD_OVERVIEW).

## Overview

In this session you will learn how to set up a CI/CD pipeline for **SAP Integration Suite** in two ways:
1. Using a Jenkins instance and creating the pipeline yourself using **Piper** commands developed specifically for **SAP Integration Suite**.
2. Making use of SAP's [**Continuous Integration and Delivery service**](https://help.sap.com/docs/CICD_OVERVIEW), which has a ready-to-use pipeline for the **SAP Integration Suite** scenario.

## Integration Scenario Details
This session uses very simple integration flow. This integration flow has a timer start and hence it will be executed on deployment.
